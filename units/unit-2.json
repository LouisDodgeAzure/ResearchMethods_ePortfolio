  "title": "Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal",
  "activities": "Initiated literature review planning and research proposal topic selection; provided peer feedback on two peer forum posts analysing ethical case studies, identifying gaps in argumentation, referencing standards, and critical depth.",
  "skills": "Developed critical evaluation skills through the peer‑review process; improved understanding of academic writing conventions (in‑text citations, reference formatting, analytical tone).",
  "impact": "Building on Unit 1's ethical frameworks, I transitioned from consuming ethical analysis to critiquing it. Recognising the gap between descriptive and analytical writing in peers' work prompted me to scrutinise my own academic voice and recognise that I often demonstrate the same tendency to slip into description rather than analysis. The transition from case study analysis to independent research topic selection marked a shift from applying existing frameworks to designing original investigations, though I initially struggled to recognise the relevance of ethics to my chosen research topic.",
