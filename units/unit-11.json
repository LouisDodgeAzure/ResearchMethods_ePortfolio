  "skills": "Strengthened self‑reflection and organisational capabilities through consistent documentation practices; improved ability to map learning outcomes to professional competencies.",
  "impact": "Maintaining ongoing reflections throughout each unit supported richer synthesis than relying solely on end‑of‑module retrospection. I believe this is the most effective e‑Portfolio I have created.",
