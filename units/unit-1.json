  "title": "Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing",
  "activities": "Completed ethical case study analysis examining dark UX patterns and their violations of ACM/BCS codes of conduct; authored essay on AI governance frameworks, analysing tensions between innovation and protection across 200+ global governance documents.",
  "skills": "Developed competency in applying professional codes (ACM, BCS) to real-world ethical scenarios; learned to evaluate academic literature on AI ethics; gained ability to identify and articulate conflicts between stakeholder interests (business objectives vs. user wellbeing vs. accessibility requirements).",
  "impact": "This unit helped me establish an ethical lens through which to evaluate subsequent research activities. Understanding the plurality of ethical frameworks (Western vs. Indigenous perspectives, innovation vs. protection) prepared me to recognise that research ethics similarly involves building consensus between competing valid perspectives.",
