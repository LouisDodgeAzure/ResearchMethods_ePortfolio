  "title": "Data Analysis and Visualisation",
  "activities": "Completed inference worksheet applying null hypothesis testing and p‑value interpretation; studied qualitative data analysis through data coding techniques (BRM, 2021); explored data visualisation principles including chart selection criteria; engaged with the FT Visual Vocabulary Guide and Berenson et al. (2015) chapters on graphical presentation and statistical analysis.",
  "skills": "Gained competency in selecting appropriate visualisations based on data type and analytical purpose (histograms for distribution, spine charts for deviation, bar charts for comparison); learned qualitative coding methodology for thematic analysis; strengthened hypothesis testing skills through application of p‑values and statistical significance.",
  "impact": "In this unit, I significantly improved my awareness of the variety of visualisations available, as well as how best to apply them. I also came to recognise the ways in which visualisation choices shape interpretations. For instance, changing whether a given axis starts from 0 can dramatically alter how viewers perceive differences between data points, potentially exaggerating or downplaying trends.",
