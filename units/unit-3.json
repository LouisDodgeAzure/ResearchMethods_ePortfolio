  "title": "Methodology and Research Methods",
  "activities": "Completed summary reflection on Dark UX Patterns analysis, critically evaluating my work's strengths and limitations; engaged with foundational texts on research design, methodologies, and paradigms (Dawson, 2015; BRM, 2018) to understand philosophical underpinnings of research approaches.",
  "skills": "Developed metacognitive skills through self‑evaluation of my ethical analysis; gained understanding of research paradigms (positivist, interpretivist, pragmatic) and their relationship to research method selection; learned to distinguish between qualitative, quantitative, and mixed‑methods approaches as well as understanding their relative strengths and weaknesses; began recognising how research questions shape methodological choices.",
  "impact": "Building on Unit 2's research topic identification, this unit provided the methodological toolkit needed to help me construct a robust research design. This reframing prepared me to justify methodological choices in my forthcoming research proposal.",
